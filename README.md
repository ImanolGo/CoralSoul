# CoralSoul

Coral Soul is a project comissioned to Emotion Technlogies (http://emotionandtechnologies.com/) for the Royal Hideaway Corales Resort. The idea is to transform the reception of the hotel into an immersive space, using the volcanic rock present throughout the site. 

Taking advantage of its grandeur and its integration into the structure of the reception, it has been committed to give life to one of the rocks through video mapping. Using this technique and 3D scanning, you can equip the rock with a content that allows you to give it a new presence and make it the element that presides over the space. Taking advantage of the fact that they are natural elements - volcanic rock and corals - which predominate throughout the hotel, we will create the audiovisual contents following the golden ratio and the succession of Fibonacci, since the geometry and proportionality offered to the viewer is necessary to obtain a visual harmony.

This software provides a generative visuals controlled by real time weather and sensory data. It also controlles the backround sound according to the data events.
